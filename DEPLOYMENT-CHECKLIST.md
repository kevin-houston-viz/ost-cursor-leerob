## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Frontend is accessible via HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Backend API is responding
- ‚úÖ Database is connected and operational
- ‚úÖ Health check returns healthy status
- ‚úÖ All core features work:
  - Create OST trees
  - Add/edit/delete nodes
  - Export to PNG/PDF
  - Dark/Light mode toggle
- ‚úÖ No critical errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Performance meets targets
- ‚úÖ Monitoring is active

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check:
1. Build logs in Vercel/Railway dashboard
2. Environment variables are set correctly
3. Database connection string is correct
4. CORS settings allow frontend domain
5. Health check endpoint responds
6. Node version compatibility
7. Dependencies installed correctly

Refer to `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps.
