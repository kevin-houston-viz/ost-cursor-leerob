## Understanding Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

**Definition & Origin**

An **Opportunity Solution Tree** (OST) is a visual framework conceived by Teresa Torres (circa 2016) to help product teams structure their discovery work in a more explicit, traceable way. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
The OST maps how a desired **outcome** (a business or product goal) connects to underlying **opportunities** (customer needs, pain points, or unmet desires), which in turn link to candidate **solutions**, and finally to **experiments** or validation tests that help decide which solutions are viable. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Torres introduced the OST as part of her *Continuous Discovery Habits* methodology, positioning it as a living model of how discovery, hypothesis testing, and product decisions evolve over time. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

**Core Components**

From top to bottom, the usual structure of an OST is:

1. **Outcome**  
   A measurable goal or objective the team wants to move. Typically, this is a **product or customer behavior metric** (rather than simply an output). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

2. **Opportunities**  
   These are the customer-facing problems, pain points, or unmet needs that, if addressed, could help toward the outcome. The distinction is that opportunities are not solutions; they represent *what customers struggle with or desire*. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

3. **Solutions**  
   For each opportunity (or a selected subset), the team ideates possible solutions—features, changes, or product experiments that might address that need. It is common to propose multiple alternative solutions per opportunity. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

4. **Experiments / Assumption Tests**  
   Rather than jump straight to building, solutions are broken down into assumptions and tested via fast experiments or prototypes (e.g. user tests, A/B tests, prototypes). The results feed back into pruning or refining the tree. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

**Why OSTs Matter / Benefits**

- They **make implicit reasoning explicit**: you can see how each solution links to opportunities and to the outcome, surfacing hidden assumptions. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- They enforce **better prioritization and focus**—you avoid building features divorced from real user problems. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- OSTs act as **shared alignment artifacts** across the product trio (PM, design, engineering) and with stakeholders, because everyone can inspect the “why behind what we’re building.” :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- They support **iterative learning**—when experiments fail, the tree is revised, pruned, or expanded, helping the team navigate uncertainty. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

**Important Nuances & Best Practices**

- The **outcome** at the top should be within the team’s influence (often a product metric), not just a high-level business KPI. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Distinguishing between opportunity and solution is critical. A “solution disguised as an opportunity” undermines the framework. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Teams typically start with generative interviews / customer research to populate the opportunity space. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- OSTs should evolve: branches get pruned or expanded as more learning occurs. It’s not a static plan. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- It’s often helpful to **reverse the tree** (i.e. from solution → opportunity → why) to test alignment and reveal hidden “why” layers. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## 1. Overview / Elevator Pitch

Ostly is a collaborative, web-native tool that enables product teams to build, evolve, and share Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs) with ease. It combines intuitive tree editing, versioning, experiment tracking, stakeholder views, and integrations with product discovery tools (e.g. interview repositories, analytics, backlog systems).

---

## 2. Purpose & Goals

### Problem Statement / Pain Points

- Many product teams still build OSTs in whiteboards, slide decks, or sticky notes, which becomes unwieldy as they scale.  
- Lack of version control or historical context means losing insight or change rationale.  
- Collaboration is fractured: different team members work in silos on user research, experiments, backlog — disconnected from the OST.  
- Stakeholder communication often requires manual translation (e.g. static exports).  
- Difficulty in iterating or refactoring the tree without losing its structure or rationale.

### Key Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric / KPI |
|---|---|
| Reduce friction in creating & maintaining OSTs | Time to initial tree creation (target: <10 minutes) |
| Increase adoption & usage | # of OSTs / active users / teams |
| Improve alignment & transparency | Stakeholder satisfaction (survey), # of views shared |
| Enable traceability & learning over time | Ratio of experiments linked to OST nodes, frequency of updates |
| Lower integration overhead | Number of upstream/downstream integrations (Jira, Notion, analytics, research) |

### Target Users / Personas

- Product managers, product owners  
- UX / product discovery leads  
- Designers, engineers in product trios  
- Stakeholders (executives, marketing, sales) needing a “view-only” lens

## 3. Key Features & Capabilities

### A. Core OST Editing & Interaction

- Drag-and-drop tree editing: intuitive creation of nodes and branching (Outcome → Opportunity → Solution → Experiment).  
- Node metadata: title, description, status, tags (e.g. hypothesis, validated, deprioritized), plus supporting notes / links.  
- Multiple levels & collapse/expand: ability to zoom into subtrees, collapse branches.  
- Styling / visual theming: color coding (by status, priority), custom icons, layout options (vertical, radial, horizontal).  
- Automatic layout algorithms: maintain readability as the tree grows.  
- Annotations / comments: comment threads on nodes (for discussions, debates).

### B. Versioning, History & Branching

- Version history / timeline: view change history, roll back to prior versions or forks.  
- Branching / experimentation lanes: mark experimental branches, fork off subtrees to test alternate paths.  
- Change justification / rationale: annotate why a node was pruned, merged, or modified.

### C. Experiment & Validation Linking

- Integrated experiment tracking: attach experiments to solution (or opportunity) nodes — e.g. A/B tests, prototypes, interviews.  
- Experiment metadata: status (planned, running, completed), results link, expected / observed metric.  
- Result-driven propagation: when an experiment’s outcome is known, ability to propagate status changes or suggestions up/down the tree.

### D. Collaboration & Team Workflows

- Real-time collaboration: simultaneous editing, live cursor presence, conflict resolution.  
- Role-based permissions / view modes: editors vs viewers, stakeholder-only mode (read-only, simplified view).  
- Comments, notifications & tasks: comment notifications, node-level assignments, reminders.  
- Shared templates / library: template OSTs (e.g. retention, engagement, onboarding), reuse across teams.

### E. Stakeholder Visualization & Export

- Simplified view mode: a clean, non-technical view of the OST (e.g. hide experiments, focus only on opportunities & solutions).  
- Presentation / slideshow mode: step through the tree for stakeholder walkthroughs.  
- Export options: PDF, PNG, embed HTML, integration with presentation tools.  
- Sharing & embed links: shareable link with read-only or interactive options.

### F. Integrations & Data Links

- Backlog / issue tracker sync: link solution nodes to Jira tickets, GitHub issues, Trello, etc.  
- Interview / research tool links: connect nodes to transcripts or notes in tools like Dovetail, Airtable.  
- Analytics dashboard linkage: connect to tools (Amplitude, Mixpanel) to show metrics or experiment results near nodes.  
- Data import / export (JSON, CSV, Graph formats): interoperability with other diagram or mapping tools.

### G. AI / Assistive Features

- Smart node suggestions: based on prior OST patterns or similar domains, propose opportunities or solutions.  
- Auto-grouping / clustering: as the tree grows, auto-suggest clustering of similar nodes or merging opportunities.  
- Text-to-node conversion: paste in bullet lists or meeting notes, convert them to candidate nodes.  
- Experiment recommendation engine: suggest likely experiments based on opportunity-solution pairs and historical data.

## 4. User Flows / Example Scenarios

### Flow A: Create a New OST from Scratch

1. User selects “New OST” → chooses or defines a template (e.g. “Increase Activation”).  
2. Enters top-level **Outcome**.  
3. Adds first-level **Opportunities**, branches, descriptive text.  
4. Selects an opportunity, adds candidate **Solutions**.  
5. Under a solution, adds **Experiments** with metadata (status, expected metric).  
6. Invites collaborators, sets permissions, and begins iterating.

### Flow B: Iteration Post-Learning

1. Team runs an experiment; user updates its result (success / failure).  
2. Ostly surfaces suggestions: e.g. prune a branch, promote an opportunity, merge two opportunities.  
3. User accepts or refines changes; history is recorded.  
4. Stakeholder view is updated automatically.

### Flow C: Stakeholder Presentation

1. PM switches to “stakeholder view” mode (hides technical detail).  
2. Walks through the tree, toggling display of experiments or deeper levels.  
3. Exports PDF or embed link; shares with stakeholders with optional annotation.

## 5. Architecture & Technical Considerations (High Level)

- **Frontend**: web-based canvas (SVG or WebGL), built with React or similar, using a diagramming / layout library (e.g. D3, JointJS, Cytoscape).  
- **Backend / Storage**: graph-based data model (nodes & edges, metadata), versioned with branching & history.  
- **Realtime Collaboration**: CRDT or Operational Transformation for concurrent editing and conflict resolution.  
- **Layout Engine**: integration or custom algorithms to auto-arrange layout (horizontal tree, radial, hierarchical).  
- **Plugin / Integration Layer**: adapters or microservices for external systems (Jira, Slack, Notion, analytics).  
- **AI / ML Services**: backend services to compute suggestions, clustering, NLP parsing, etc.

## 6. Risks, Challenges & Mitigations

| Risk / Challenge | Mitigation / Approach |
|---|---|
| Tree complexity overwhelms users | Provide collapse / zoom / focus modes, auto-grouping, pruning suggestions |
| Resistance from teams used to analog tools | Offer import from templates, hybrid whiteboard/diagram mode, onboarding tutorials |
| Versioning & merge conflicts | Adopt robust graph version control, UI for merge conflict resolution |
| Maintenance burden for integrations | Use modular architecture, versioned APIs, plugin ecosystem |
| Data privacy / embed access control | Fine-grained permissions, view-only tokens, domain restrictions, audit logs |
