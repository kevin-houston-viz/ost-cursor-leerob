# Undo/Redo Functionality Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented full undo/redo functionality for the OST Editor using the Command pattern, allowing users to reverse and replay their editing actions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Command History Service
- **Location:** `frontend/src/app/services/command-history.service.ts`
- **Pattern:** Command Pattern with undo/redo stacks
- **Features:**
  - Undo stack (max 50 commands)
  - Redo stack
  - Observable state updates for UI
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y)
  - Command execution with automatic history tracking

### 2. Node Commands
- **Location:** `frontend/src/app/services/commands/node-commands.ts`
- **Commands Implemented:**
  1. **CreateNodeCommand** - Create and undo node creation
  2. **DeleteNodeCommand** - Delete and restore nodes (with children)
  3. **UpdateNodeCommand** - Update and revert node properties
  4. **MoveNodeCommand** - Move and restore node positions

### 3. UI Integration
- **Undo Button** (↶ icon) - Ctrl+Z
- **Redo Button** (↷ icon) - Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z
- Buttons disabled when no undo/redo available
- Tooltips show keyboard shortcuts

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z** - Undo last action
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z** - Redo
- **Ctrl+Y / Cmd+Y** - Redo (alternative)
- Works globally in the editor

## Technical Implementation

### Command Pattern
Each operation (create, update, delete) is encapsulated as a Command object with:
- `execute()` - Performs the action
- `undo()` - Reverses the action
- `description` - Human-readable description

### History Management
```typescript
// Stack-based undo/redo
undoStack: Command[]  // Recently executed commands
redoStack: Command[]  // Recently undone commands

// When new command executed:
- Push to undo stack
- Clear redo stack (no redo after new action)

// When undo:
- Pop from undo stack
- Execute undo()
- Push to redo stack

// When redo:
- Pop from redo stack
- Execute execute()
- Push to undo stack
```

### Integration Points

#### Before (Direct API Calls):
```typescript
this.apiService.createNode(...).subscribe(...)
this.apiService.updateNode(...).subscribe(...)
this.apiService.deleteNode(...).subscribe(...)
```

#### After (Command Pattern):
```typescript
const command = new CreateNodeCommand(...);
this.commandHistory.executeCommand(command);

// Automatically supports undo/redo!
```

## Supported Operations

✅ **Node Creation** - Undo removes node, redo recreates it
✅ **Node Deletion** - Undo restores node (and children), redo deletes again
✅ **Node Updates** - Undo reverts to old values, redo applies new values
✅ **Position Changes** - (Ready for implementation when drag tracking added)

## User Experience

### Creating a Node:
1. User clicks "Add Outcome"
2. Node appears
3. User can press Ctrl+Z to undo → node disappears
4. User can press Ctrl+Y to redo → node reappears

### Editing a Node:
1. User double-clicks node
2. Changes title from "A" to "B"
3. Clicks Save
4. User can press Ctrl+Z → title reverts to "A"
5. User can press Ctrl+Y → title changes back to "B"

### Deleting a Node:
1. User deletes a node with children
2. Node and children disappear
3. User can press Ctrl+Z → node and children restored
4. User can press Ctrl+Y → node and children deleted again

## Benefits

1. **User Confidence** - Mistakes can be easily undone
2. **Experimentation** - Try different structures without fear
3. **Efficiency** - Faster iteration with undo/redo
4. **Professional UX** - Expected feature in modern editors

## Known Limitations

1. **History Not Persisted** - Undo history is lost on page refresh (by design for MVP)
2. **No Partial Undo** - Can't skip to specific history state (stack-based only)
3. **Max 50 Commands** - Older commands are dropped to prevent memory issues
4. **Position Changes** - Move command exists but not yet wired to drag events

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

- [ ] Visual history timeline showing all past actions
- [ ] Branch/fork history (non-linear undo)
- [ ] Persist history to backend for cross-session undo
- [ ] Collaborative undo (resolve conflicts when multiple users edit)
- [ ] Undo descriptions in UI ("Undo Create Outcome")
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut customization

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create node → Undo → Redo
- [ ] Delete node → Undo → Redo
- [ ] Edit node → Undo → Redo
- [ ] Create multiple nodes → Undo all → Redo all
- [ ] Create node with children → Delete parent → Undo (restores all)
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- [ ] Verify buttons disabled when no undo/redo available
- [ ] Test in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Create 50+ nodes to test history limit

### Automated E2E Tests (Future)
- Command execution adds to history
- Undo reverses operation
- Redo replays operation
- Keyboard shortcuts work
- UI buttons reflect state

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
1. `frontend/src/app/services/command-history.service.ts` - Core service
2. `frontend/src/app/services/commands/node-commands.ts` - Command implementations

### Modified Files:
1. `frontend/src/app/editor/editor.ts` - Integrated commands
2. `frontend/src/app/editor/editor.html` - Added undo/redo buttons

## Next Steps (Per Plan)

Undo/redo is now complete! Next priorities from Week 7-8:

1. **Version History** (Related to undo/redo)
   - Save snapshots to backend
   - Version comparison UI
   - Restore from version

2. **Templates** (High priority for MVP)
   - Create 3 OST templates
   - Template selection UI
   - Pre-populated trees

3. **Onboarding Tour**
   - Interactive walkthrough
   - Feature highlights
   - Skip options
