# Ostly Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan breaks down the Ostly product brief into iterative development phases, focusing on delivering value incrementally while building toward the full vision of a collaborative OST (Opportunity Solution Tree) editor.

## Core Product Understanding
**Ostly** is a web-native tool for product teams to build, evolve, and share Opportunity Solution Trees. The tool addresses key pain points:
- Teams using whiteboards/slides for OSTs (unwieldy at scale)
- Lack of version control and historical context
- Fractured collaboration across teams
- Manual stakeholder communication
- Difficulty iterating without losing structure

## Success Metrics & Goals
- **Time to value**: <10 minutes for initial tree creation
- **Adoption**: # of OSTs, active users, teams
- **Alignment**: Stakeholder satisfaction, # of views shared
- **Traceability**: Ratio of experiments linked to nodes
- **Integration**: Number of upstream/downstream integrations

- [x] Create basic project structure (frontend + backend repos)
- [x] Configure Git repository with descriptive commit message templates
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL in Docker container
- [x] Configure ESLint 9 + Prettier for code quality

## üö® Areas Requiring Clarification (Risk Assessment)

### **HIGH PRIORITY - Clarify Before Starting**

#### **1. ~~Real-time Collaboration Scope~~** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Decision**: Deferred to later phase, not in MVP

#### **2. ~~Authentication & User Management~~** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Decision**: Not needed for MVP, deferred to later phase

#### **3. Data Model & Schema** ‚úÖ RESOLVED (with clarification needed)
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL with adjacency list for tree structure
- **Node Storage**: 500 characters text per node
- **Tree Levels**: Outcome ‚Üí Opportunity ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Experiment (4 levels)

**Proposed Schema (for Week 0 review):**

```sql
-- OST Trees Table
CREATE TABLE ost_trees (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Nodes Table (adjacency list pattern)
CREATE TABLE nodes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tree_id UUID REFERENCES ost_trees(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_id UUID REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  node_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (node_type IN ('outcome', 'opportunity', 'solution', 'experiment')),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT CHECK (LENGTH(description) <= 500),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',
  color VARCHAR(7), -- hex color code
  position_x DECIMAL(10,2),
  position_y DECIMAL(10,2),
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP -- soft delete
);

-- Version History (snapshot approach for simplicity)
CREATE TABLE tree_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tree_id UUID REFERENCES ost_trees(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  version_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  snapshot JSONB NOT NULL, -- full tree snapshot
  change_description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_tree_id ON nodes(tree_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_parent_id ON nodes(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_type ON nodes(node_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_tree_versions_tree_id ON tree_versions(tree_id);
```

**Questions for Week 0**:
- [ ] Add user ownership when auth is implemented?
- [ ] Include node metadata (tags, links, attachments)?
- [ ] Version history: snapshots (simple) or deltas (efficient)?
- [ ] Soft delete (deleted_at) or hard delete?

#### **4. ~~SVG Diagramming Library Choice~~** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Decision**: AntV X6 (powerful graph editing framework, supports Angular)

#### **5. Export Implementation Details** (Technical Challenges & Solutions)

**Challenges with SVG-to-PNG/PDF Export:**
1. **Font rendering issues** - Custom fonts may not render correctly
2. **External resources** - Images, icons might not embed properly  
3. **Canvas size limits** - Browser limits on canvas dimensions
4. **Color accuracy** - Dark/light mode colors need to be preserved
5. **Quality/resolution** - Need high DPI for professional output

**Recommended Solutions:**

**Option A: Client-side Export (Simpler, good for MVP)**
- **PNG**: Use AntV X6's built-in `graph.exportPNG()` method
  - Pros: Simple, no server needed, works offline
  - Cons: Limited control over quality, browser limitations
- **PDF**: Use AntV X6 PNG export + jsPDF library
  - Convert PNG to PDF on client side
  - Pros: Works offline, simple implementation
  - Cons: Larger file sizes, quality limited by PNG

**Option B: Server-side Export (Better quality, Phase 2)**
- **Use Puppeteer or Playwright** (you already have Playwright!)
  - Render the OST in headless browser
  - Capture high-quality screenshot or PDF
  - Pros: Full control, high quality, consistent output
  - Cons: Requires server resources, more complex

**MVP Recommendation:**
- [ ] **Week 2: Use AntV X6 built-in export** (simplest path)
- [ ] **Week 3: Test with dark/light mode themes**
- [ ] **Week 4: Add quality/DPI options if needed**
- [ ] **Phase 2: Migrate to Playwright-based server export** (for better quality)

**Code Example (AntV X6):**
```typescript
// PNG Export
graph.exportPNG('my-ost', {
  quality: 1,
  backgroundColor: theme === 'dark' ? '#1a1a1a' : '#ffffff'
});

// PDF Export (via jsPDF)
const dataUrl = await graph.exportPNG();
const pdf = new jsPDF();
pdf.addImage(dataUrl, 'PNG', 0, 0);
pdf.save('my-ost.pdf');
```

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Clarify During Development**

#### **6. Color System & Theme Design**
- **Risk**: "Intentional use of color" is subjective
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] Specific color palette for node types?
  - [ ] Color coding rules (by type, status, priority)?
  - [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA/AAA)?
  - [ ] How colors translate between light/dark mode?
- **Recommendation**: Define color system in Week 1, create design tokens

#### **7. Comments & @Mentions Implementation**
- **Risk**: Requires notification system not specified
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] Where do comments live? (node-level, canvas-level, both?)
  - [ ] Notification delivery? (email, in-app, both?)
  - [ ] Reply threads or flat comments?
  - [ ] Edit/delete comment permissions?
- **Recommendation**: Define comment UX pattern in Week 5

#### **8. Template Content & Structure**
- **Risk**: Templates mentioned but content undefined
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] Exact structure of each template (nodes, relationships)?
  - [ ] Pre-filled content vs placeholder text?
  - [ ] Are templates editable or fixed?
  - [ ] Template versioning as product evolves?
- **Recommendation**: Create template content in Week 7

#### **9. Onboarding Tour Implementation**
- **Risk**: Tour mechanism not specified
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] Tour library? (Shepherd.js, Intro.js, Driver.js, custom?)
  - [ ] Interactive vs passive tour?
  - [ ] Progress tracking and skip functionality?
  - [ ] Mobile-responsive tour (for future)?
- **Recommendation**: Choose tour library in Week 7

#### **10. Performance & Optimization Strategy**
- **Risk**: 250 nodes could impact performance
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] Virtualization approach for large trees?
  - [ ] Lazy loading strategies?
  - [ ] Rendering optimization (canvas vs SVG performance)?
  - [ ] Acceptable load time targets?
- **Recommendation**: Set performance budgets, add monitoring

### **LOW PRIORITY - Can Evolve**

#### **11. Version History UI/UX**
- **Risk**: Version comparison can be complex
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] How to display version history? (timeline, list, visual diff?)
  - [ ] What granularity? (every change, snapshots, manual saves?)
  - [ ] Restore vs preview old versions?
- **Recommendation**: Simple version list for MVP, enhance later

#### **12. Conflict Resolution Approach**
- **Risk**: User experience for conflicts unclear
- **Questions**:
  - [ ] How to show conflicts to users?
  - [ ] Manual resolution vs automatic?
  - [ ] Prevention vs resolution focus?
- **Recommendation**: Start simple, refine based on user feedback
